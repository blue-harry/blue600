        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class
        functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also
        use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
        programming) styles.
